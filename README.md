ðŸ“Š Zepto Inventory Dataset â€“ Business Insights & Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes Zeptoâ€™s Inventory Dataset to uncover business-critical insights regarding product pricing, discounts, availability, and category-level performance.
The dataset simulates real-world retail/e-commerce inventory management where businesses must optimize stock levels, discounts, and pricing strategies to maximize revenue and customer satisfaction.
The analysis leverages SQL queries for data exploration, cleaning, and insight generation.

ðŸ—‚ Dataset Structure
The dataset is stored in a single table ZEPTO with the following schema:

| Column Name              | Data Type    | Description                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `SKU_ID`                 | SERIAL (PK)  | Unique identifier for each product                    |
| `CATEGORY`               | VARCHAR(120) | Product category (e.g., Grocery, Dairy, Beverages)    |
| `NAME`                   | VARCHAR(120) | Product name                                          |
| `MRP`                    | NUMERIC(8,2) | Maximum Retail Price                                  |
| `DISCOUNTPERCENT`        | NUMERIC(5,2) | Discount percentage applied                           |
| `AVAILABLEQUANTITY`      | INTEGER      | Number of items available in stock                    |
| `DISCOUNTEDSELLINGPRICE` | NUMERIC(8,2) | Final selling price after discount                    |
| `WEIGHTINGMS`            | INTEGER      | Weight in grams                                       |
| `OUTOFSTOCK`             | BOOLEAN      | Indicates if the product is out of stock              |
| `QUANTITY`               | INTEGER      | Ordered quantity (historical transaction perspective) |


ðŸ›  Data Cleaning & Preparation

Key steps taken to ensure data quality:

âœ… Removed products with invalid prices (MRP = 0 or DiscountedSellingPrice = 0).
âœ… Corrected data format issues by scaling prices appropriately (MRP/100, SellingPrice/100).
âœ… Checked for null values across all columns.
âœ… Identified and managed duplicate product names.
This ensures our insights are reliable for decision-making.

ðŸ”Ž Business Insights from Analysis

1. Inventory Overview

Verified total product count.
Assessed out-of-stock products across categories.
Identified duplicate product names & cleaned.

2. Discount Analysis

Top 10 highest discounted products identified.
Categories with highest average discount percentage surfaced.
Highlighted high-value products with minimal discounts (premium strategy).

3. Revenue Insights

Calculated total revenue per category (Selling Price Ã— Available Quantity).
Found best-performing categories in terms of sales contribution.
Cross-checked high-value products that are out of stock (lost sales potential).

4. Price vs Weight Optimization

Computed price per gram for products above 100g.
Identified products delivering best value for money.
Grouped products into Low, Medium, Bulk weight categories for inventory strategy.

5. Inventory Weight Contribution
   
Aggregated total weight per category.
Highlighted which categories dominate logistics & storage costs.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

âš¡ High-revenue categories drive most of the business â†’ can prioritize for supply chain efficiency.
